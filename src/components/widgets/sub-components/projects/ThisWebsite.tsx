      This website was created using React, Typescript, and react-grid-layout.
      All gifs are hosted using embedded Giphy. Itâ€™s intent is to showcase a few of my projects while giving me an excuse to further my frontend skills
      To achieve this goal, I put a few artificial challenges in place. The grid itself can be adjusted and a new layout generated from the placement. 
      Furthermore, adding a new item to the config will add the button to the relevent section, though a customized view can be added later to refine the view.
