      I have a love-hate relationship with Java. I learned this language after C++ and found the naming conventions more to my liking. It was years after using C++ that I learned what cout and cin stood for. It's obvious now, but hindsight and all. Unfortunately C++ and python are infested with functions and classes that are only recognizable after using them enough to memorize them or looking them up every time.

      While I prefer the longer naming style of Java, it went too far. Small-scale projects require half a dozen sub folders that I will never use. Sure, it makes things scalable, but it also makes using any hierarchy view a pain. I haven't used Java in a few years though, hopefully itâ€™s improved.
